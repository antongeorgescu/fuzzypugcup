### Introduction ###

This is a chess tournament that is getting played online and has a few simple ***rules***:
* the players have to know how to play a modicum of chess
* the players must know that the **Queen** keeps its colour
* no, the horse shaped pieces are not called "horses", but **Knights** although no knight riding that horse
* the **King** is taller than the Queen, although the Queen is way stronger and most determined (*very much like in real life!*)
* please respect the lives of the **Pawns** and do not sacrifice them too soon; many times you will realize that you depend on the little guy who can shade off his skin and even become a Queen
* the **Bishop** has very much the power of a Knight, which is not quite true: while at the court and entertaining politics, the Bishop is as strong as a duke or a lord, while the Knight is a military guy easily dispensable, in an impossible world the Bishop should stick to spiritual meditation while the Knight should focus on materialistic butchering
* there are <ins>3 points rewarded for a win and 1 point for a draw</ins>; it goes without saying that the loser takes 0 points
